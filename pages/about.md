Hey, I'm Vijay 👨‍💻 – a seasoned senior software engineer and outcome-driven technical lead with a knack for steering engineering towards substantial impact.

**🚀 Experience Highlights:**

I've crafted impactful B2B and B2C SaaS products spanning diverse industries – prop-tech, ed-tech, ad-tech, banking, energy, and defence.

Spearheaded the development of data-intensive applications for renowned scale-up organisations:

- UK energy provisioning system at First Utility/Shell Energy.

I am a full-stack engineer developing with both Python and Typescript stacks. I have extensively used cloud infrastructure, specifically AWS and Google Cloud.

I specialise in backend engineering, with a knack for designing and building scalable data systems - from services, APIs, and event-driven systems to data models, machine learning models, storage systems, and data processing pipelines.
