2022 was a year of work-life balance - tending to things outside work whilst pushing forward work goals. Here is my year in review. How did your year go in both work and life?

## Work
- Delivered 3 key data products in existing and new markets
- Lost count of the number of people interviewed!
- Onboarded 2 new people into the team
- Supported the professional growth of 4 people with one successful promotion
- 130+ hours of coaching and mentoring via 1-2-1s
- Helped shape a technical vision for a low-code data platform
- Facilitated improvement of team's 13 health check indicators shifting 7 to green status, and 5 to non-urgent amber
- Documented parts of the team's handbook
- Chatted on the [Enginears podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBLqKLrCUmA) about  data platforming
- Ran a 9-person department-level 3-day workshop
- Buddy and mentor for [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/) - disappointed there wasn't enough time for this
- Wrote several blog posts - not as many as hoped for
- Read 14 non-fiction books, mostly on leadership

## Life
- Moved house and city - the top stressor of the year!
- Several weekends of DIY with my Dad, including fitting a fence
- Learnt gardening maintenance - taming grass, trees and hedges!
- Spent more time with my family versus living in London
- Saw two of my younger cousin's school musical performances
- Took a holiday abroad (first since 2019)
- Read 8 fiction books
- Read more than ever on politics and economics
- Reduced financial debt by 70% - an anxiety reducer for sure!
- Saved a healthy travel budget for 2023
- Mastered several recipes from a Malaysian cookbook
- Consistently used the gym twice a week
