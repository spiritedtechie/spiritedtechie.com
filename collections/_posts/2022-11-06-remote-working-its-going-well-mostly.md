When Covid hit in March 2019 my then-employer sent us away to work from home. Since then, I have not reverted to the regular office working approach. Life has been entirely work from home, with my present employer supporting remote working. I joined whilst lockdowns were still happening, but the company moved to become remote first shortly after.

Will I give anything insightful here? I am not sure - this is simply a personal reflection of that change after 14 years of working in an office. Perhaps in 5 years, I could be looking back at 2021/2022 and reflecting "that was an interesting time". I hope these notes capture my feelings about how the move to remote working affected my life.

It feels ordinary now to be working from home and on balance, I am better off with this working model. 

## What were the positive outcomes?
I have more control and choice. If I were to sum it up in one word, I feel empowered with my time and place.
- **Moving home** - I moved house and found time for viewings that would otherwise have been impossible with an office presence. Home moving is stressful, but I suspect even more grey hairs without remote working. This was huge. The ability to attend those last-minute, high-demand, viewings secured my new home.
- **Family time** - I moved out of London, and closer to family in the Midlands. As my parents grow older it is right for me to be near them. My work is the same, but my free time towards family has grown massively. Friday night takeaway with my parents and siblings - no problem. Family events attendance - sure thing. Popping over to see family after work - effortless.
- **Closer to the country** - In my late thirties, my desire to be in the big city has declined whilst my love of nature has grown. I still love London, but it gives me less enjoyment. Now I am an hour away from some of the finest countryside the in the UK. It takes one hour to travel to London to see friends, but the tradeoff was worth it. Bonus: the charm of London stays alive for me.
- **Time to learn** - I have made rapid progress with my interest areas, reading many books on a much broader range of topics. I have expanded into reading about history, psychology, economics, and politics. The last few years have been massive self-led educational growth.
- **Less drinking** - My socials habits have naturally dropped off compared to my 20s/early 30s. Nevertheless, in an office environment, it was common to meet colleagues or friends for drinks at least 2 times a week - that suddenly stopped. Right now, I would consider myself a tee-total. If I went back to the office, I would be better able to say no alcohol. This is a positive change for me.
- **Home cooking** - I cook my own meals most days. I have experimented with more recipes than ever before in my life. Not great for the economy, but great for my own personal growth. My love of food has deepened as I research various foods. And I have the time to make all those wonderful things I tasted whilst previously travelling.
- **More rounded team player** - Initial adaptation to remote working was brutal and my career learning stagnated. It generated uncertainty about my effectiveness if not physically present. But after the first year, I was able to develop ways to collaborate remotely more effectively (and help others too!). I have refined my communication and capitalised on the use of asynchronous communication. I built a fully remote, well-gelled, team that builds great products.
- **Professional growth**- As an introvert, more alone time has allowed me to reflect and learn much more deeply. My perspective on work, people, teams and organisations has changed and expanded, and so has my emotional intelligence. Being present in the office meant I was always "on", and finding time to reflect and challenge myself was incredibly difficult.

## What were the challenges?
There are things I need to watch out for and be more proactive about.
- **Less movement** - I no longer walk as much as when commuting to the office (there were at least the walks to and from public transport). However, I am eating less and my weight has not changed much - I still feel healthy. I go to the gym once or twice a week, yet worry I am still not moving enough. Incorporated more weekend hikes to help balance things. And taking up gardening and DIY has helped. The consistent daily movement is what has declined.
- **Less time with friends** - "London's only an hour away". But those spontaneous moments with friends no longer happen when you are not living in the same postcode. I keep in touch with some friends, but others, I see a lot less. There is a cognitive distance people perceive when in different cities. Though I actively maintain relationships where possible and can only do my best.
- **Less travel** - travel is one of the closest things to my heart. I have done it consistently throughout my life post-university and attribute much of my growth to it. Then Covid hit and travel experiences stopped. Obviously, much was out of my control; still, travel feels out of reach for me cognitively. Big travel adventures feel hard to achieve - previously, I had the confidence to plan and make it happen. I want to change this as nothing stops me from reincorporating travel back into my life.
- **More anxiety** - my mind has worked overtime with lots of learning about myself and the world and processing all the recent terrible events. More time to overthink has generated lows that I have never felt before in my life. I have lost sleep, cried, and felt alone, like a stranger and imposter. In the end, it was a growth that I needed. It was worth it. I can form bigger life plans and be more strategic and intentional. I feel more in control of my life now, but that brings new fears too to confront.

One could argue some of these changes were going to happen anyway. I agree; however, Covid, and the new norm of remote working, created a snowball effect in my life. The freedom that remote working provided has enabled bigger life changes to occur sooner and forced me to confront/adapt/grow in a much more compressed amount of time. Despite all the negative consequences that Covid generated, I hope others found some light from those changes.
