Here is my default motto for broad-level time spent on different kinds of work: **80% on complex. 20% on disruptive**. That's it. 

Yes, there is a difference - the complex space is (or should be) inherently innovative, whilst disruptive work is more inventive. More below.

The percentages are a personal choice shaped by context and experience. Proportions vary for different people and organisations; nevertheless, the nature of the problem changes in each space.

## 80-90% on complex stuff:
- Goal is clearer
- Problems are complex
- Iterative innovation for solutions
- Context matters in decisions
- Things are productised & scaled
- Some may consider it "boring"

## 10-20% on disruptive stuff:
- Goal and problem is less clear
- Understanding potential
- Discover goals, problems & products
- Solutions are fringe and inventive
- Move fast and experiment
- Critical thinking matters even more
- Identify practical opportunities
- Understand limitations
- MAY generate something actionable
- High chance of failure

## 0% on simple stuff:
- Low complexity
- Well-understood
- Best practice
- Repeatable without context
- Run the playbook
- Can (and should) be automated
- Soul-crushing (to me, at least)

In the past, I have seen innovation reduced to a small percentage of the time, say 20%. That's not right for me, as I prefer continually innovating in the 80% space. The 20% space is the land of game-changing invention, from which only a few outputs become actionable innovations. 

For example, it's wasteful (and potentially dangerous) to spend 20% incorporating that library or framework to solve an immediate problem. That kind of innovation is part and parcel of the 80% allocation.

It's a sign of a cultural problem if an organisation pushes innovation to only a fraction of the time (or completely eliminates any time for innovation or disruption). This could quickly bite if competitors are doing the opposite. Similarly, if organisations expect innovation outside of work hours. 

The opposite is true also - 80% spent in the disruptive space, with nothing being built and productised. Perhaps it's necessary if your product success relies on pivoting fast and staying ahead. But what are the constraints of the product in such a disruptive space? There will be some whether you want it or not!

Is it an anti-pattern to have dedicated roles or teams for disruption or innovation - would everyone else get bored and resentful quickly? I believe the people best placed to generate innovations are closest to the problem, the practicality and the long-term impact. But it does require a shift in mindset as you move to a more disruptive space.

Would be keen to know how you make this work in your teams and organisations. Do you define spaces of work and ways of thinking about things in those spaces? Are you making progress in each of your high-impact spaces?
