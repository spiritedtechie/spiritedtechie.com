Here is my default motto for time spent on different kinds of work: **80% on complex and 20% on disruptive**.

The complex space involves continuous innovation, while the disruptive space is focused on bleeding-edge invention.

## 80-90% on the complex:
* Goal is more clear
* Problems are complex
* Iterative innovation on solutions
* Context matters for decisions
* Pivot less often
* Things are productised & scaled
* It may be considered “boring”

## 10-20% on the disruptive:
* Goal and problem is less clear
* Understanding potential
* Discover goals, problems & products
* Solutions can be fringe and inventive
* Move fast and pivot often
* Critical thinking matters even more
* Identify practical opportunities
* Understand limitations
* MAY generate something actionable
* Higher chance of failure

## 0% on the simple:
* Low complexity
* Well-understood
* Best practice
* Repeatable without context
* Run the playbook
* Can be automated
* Soul-crushing (to me, at least)

The percentages are a personal preference shaped by context and experience. Proportions vary for different people and organisations; nevertheless, the nature of problems changes in each space.

In the past, I have seen organisations reduce all innovation or disruption to a small percentage of the time. I instead advocate for continuous innovation. Any dedicated time is reserved for game-changing disruptive projects.

An example might help explain the difference. Integrating a new framework to solve an immediate problem could be considered an innovation - it is practical and implementable. Contrast this with cutting-edge research in the latest AI techniques - this is disruptive, and the challenge is to identify scalable products, solutions and practical ways forward. This is experimental to the extreme.

Some organisations limit innovation and/or disruption to only a fraction of the time (or remove the time altogether). Organisations could suffer consequences if their competitors do the opposite and reap the rewards.

What about the opposite - 80% spent in the disruptive space, with nothing being productised and scaled. Perhaps this is necessary initially to pivot fast and stay ahead. However, eventually, a product needs to be defined, built and scaled. Constraints need to be identified for early-stage products in such a disruptive space - there will be some whether you want it or not! Constant change whilst trying to scale every opportunity is futile - data, critical thinking and strategy are required to make the right bets and move toward practicality.

Is it an anti-pattern to have dedicated roles or teams for disruption or innovation - would everyone else get bored and resentful quickly? Those best placed to evaluate innovations are closest to the execution and ops - their buy-in is critical. However, it does require a shift in mindset towards a more disruptive way of thinking.

Would be keen to know how you make this work in your teams and organisations.
