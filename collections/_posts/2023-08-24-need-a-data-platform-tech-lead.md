## Background and Experience

As I transition back into full-time employment, I consider how best to apply my skills and contribute effectively to organisations. Why? - There could be challenges that align perfectly with my expertise and problem-solving abilities.

In terms of my background, I come with a wealth of over 15 years of practical experience in software engineering. My journey has encompassed various roles, from being an individual contributor to taking the helm as a technical lead or engineering manager. These roles have spanned diverse industries, allowing me to craft solutions for applications, mobile, and data products.

My extensive experience as a backend software engineer has helped propel my contribution to the data engineering space, fluently applying well-practised engineering approaches such as DevOps to the data space.

## Role and Focus

I am a technology leader with a focus on constructing robust data platforms. I use technology to address complex business problems: this doesn't always translate into writing code, although I'm fully capable of building well-architected code. My primary emphasis, however, rests on creating and integrating innovative, reliable and enduring solutions - whether they are buy, build or a combination of both.

## Technical Leadership and Management

Most of my experience has been managing small teams (5 to 7 people) as a hybrid Technical Lead Manager. I can fluently operate as an IC Technical Lead (with a technical system focus), working alongside Engineering Management to align technology with organisational aspects. Equally, I can serve as an Engineering Manager for a team focused more on people, delegating technical leadership to senior ICs. Regardless of the role, I like to balance my contributions to people, processes and technology rather than focusing purely on technology or people. I won't be the best coder in the team, though I have considerable product delivery, technical and architectural experience to help guide teams in the right direction for the organisation.

## Data Platform Engineering

I consider data platform engineering a logical extension of data engineering. They both share similarities but diverge in objective. Data platform engineers create intuitive tooling and abstractions that efficiently facilitate the creation of data products. The essence of data platforms lies in patterns, abstraction and reuse, thus supporting scalability through breadth of applicability. As a data engineer, this is where my interest lies.

## Passion for Data Platforms and Data Quality

My fascination with data platforms stems from observing the immense pressure placed on small, centralised data teams to hasten the delivery of data products. Often, I notice a repetitive cycle of data pipeline creation, sometimes leading to suboptimal results. My motivation is to enhance efficiency through platforming, discover effective abstractions, and create tools for faster data product development. Consequently, this enables data engineers to apply themselves to more specialised or complex data problems.

Data quality is another domain that intrigues me. Often, it takes a back seat in the rush to deliver data to consumers. A robust platform for data quality testing and contract creation can lead to gradual but steady improvements in data quality and accelerate data product delivery. Stakeholder collaboration combined with automation is critical for getting the data quality right.

## Contributions to Data Platforms

I identify and lead on high-leverage problems. Here's where my expertise comes into play:

- **Data Platform Strategy:** Collaborate cross-functionally with stakeholders to identify short and long-term needs. Design architectural solutions, and align technical roadmaps.
- **Data Generation:** Work with data producers and owners to ensure data is available for downstream use cases.
- **Data Quality:** Collaborate with data producers to elevate data quality, whilst establishing data quality testing infrastructure for automated testing.
- **Data Storage:** Establish scalable storage systems such as analytical data warehouses or lakes. 
- **Data Orchestration:** Configure scalable and observable orchestration systems for complex processing flows.
- **Data Ingestion:** Integrate extraction tools to diversify available data sources. Create scalable infrastructure for ingestion of large data volumes.
- **Data Transformation:** Create reusable transformation logic and shared models, determining optimal data structures/formats. Craft or integrate tools that empower self-serve transformations. 
- **Data Serving** - Make data available for analytics, or external systems via APIs and reverse-ETL processes.
- **Data Metadata** - Identify metadata (including lineage data) across the platform and integrate it into cataloguing systems, maximising observability and traceability.
- **Semantic Layer:** Develop or integrate tools for defining business metrics from centralised data. Establish shared models for organisation-wide metric definitions.
- **DataOps:** All this requires a mindset of automation on all parts of the platform, combining SLAs and monitoring to build towards low lead times for data product value.

## Unique Contributions and Attributes

Ultimately, what sets me apart are the following attributes:

- **Strategic Thinking:** I excel at crafting a technical vision aligned with overarching strategic business objectives, ensuring present efforts align with future goals.
- **Iterative Delivery:** While future alignment is crucial, I'm equally skilled at challenging unnecessary complexities in the present and charting incremental pathways to realisation.
- **Commercial Focus:** My commitment extends to assessing the business value of every endeavour and seeking clarity on outcomes and impact.
- **Empathetic Leadership:** Understanding stakeholder goals and pain points is a priority. I help align vision and objectives across teams and functions, prompting positive action from all involved.
- **Cultivating Growth:** I'm dedicated to nurturing technical teams through mentorship and delegation, elevating technical prowess to realise goals.

## Concrete Example

Let me provide an example from my tenure at LandTech. Here, I spearheaded the development of an end-to-end data platform that transformed the integration of geometric datasets into data products for application use. This initiative significantly accelerated data product delivery from several weeks to days, securing considerable recurring revenue for the company and empowering experimentation. Alongside my team, the journey unfolded as follows:

- **Architectural Vision:** Led efforts to shape a robust architectural vision for the data platform, harmonising the efforts across three engineering teams and aligning technical roadmaps.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Partnered with a wide range of stakeholders, gaining insights into strategic goals and pain points, establishing a product-aligned platform roadmap that continuously delivered value.
- **Orchestration Platform:** Championed and installed a data workflow orchestration tool (Prefect) that replaced all core custom-scripted data flows, reducing the cost of ownership.
- **Unified Data Model:** Led cocreation of a unified data model accommodating multiple geometric datasets (PostGIS), devising a partitioning strategy for data to support scale.
- **Data Quality Infrastructure:** Introduced low-code data testing tools (DBT), bolstering data quality and laying the infrastructure for automated data quality.
- **Transform Layer Efficiency:** Defined architecture for reusable components within a transform layer (DBT), eliminating redundancy in transformation logic, and enabling streamlined additions of new datasets.
- **Data Serving:** Expedited the development of the data model and data serving layer by identifying and revamping existing system components.
- **Engaging Data Producers:** Collaborated with data producers (internal and external) to define data requirements, quality standards and ingestion architecture.
- **Buy Over Build:** Led the removal of a custom-built data generation (geometry tracing) tool for an open-source alternative (QGIS), reducing the total cost of ownership.
- **Team Growth:** Built a data engineering team from the ground up, coaching a senior engineer to a technical lead position and growing an engineer to a senior engineer. 
- **Function Growth:** Hired engineers, peer leads and senior leadership across the department, being a key contributor in growing the data engineering function from one team to three teams.

The above crystalises my approach and commitment to strategic challenges, crafting impactful solutions using technical and organisational chops.
