## Background and Experience
As I transition back into full-time employment, I'm taking a deep dive into contemplating where I can best apply my skills and how I can contribute effectively to organisations. There may be challenges out there that align perfectly with my expertise and problem-solving abilities.

In terms of my background, I come with a wealth of over 15 years of practical experience in software engineering. My journey has encompassed various roles, from being an individual contributor to taking the helm as a technical lead. These roles have spanned diverse industries, allowing me to craft solutions for applications, mobile platforms, and data products.

## Role and Focus

I am a technical lead with a focus on constructing robust data platforms. I use technology to address complex business problems: this doesn't always translate into writing code, although I'm fully capable of building well-architected code. My primary emphasis, however, rests on creating innovative, reliable and enduring solutions.

## Technical Leadership and Management

While I've managed small teams in the past as a Lead Engineer, I'm not on a trajectory toward becoming an Engineering Manager. Instead, I see myself as a Staff Engineer who collaborates closely with Engineering Managers to provide high-level technical leadership. This arrangement also allows me to channel my efforts into fostering team growth without veering into a management career.

## Data Platform Engineering vs. Data Engineering

Although I'm deeply involved in data platforms, I'm not exactly a data engineer. Whilst data engineering and data platform engineering share similarities, they diverge significantly. Data engineers focus on data processing, leveraging their domain expertise. On the flip side, data platform engineers create intuitive platform tooling that facilitates the efficient creation of data products for diverse users, including non-technical ones. The essence of data platforms lies in their scalability and breadth.

## Passion for Data Platforms and Data Quality

My fascination with data platforms stems from observing the immense pressure placed on small, centralised data teams to hasten the delivery of data products. Often, I notice a repetitive cycle of data pipeline creation, sometimes leading to suboptimal results. My motivation is to enhance platform efficiency, discover effective abstractions, and create user-friendly tools for data product development. Consequently, this would leave more complex problems to skilled engineers.

Data quality is another domain that deeply intrigues me. Often, it takes a back seat in the rush to deliver data to consumers. I  believe that a robust platform for data quality testing and contract creation can lead to gradual but steady improvements in data quality.

## Contributions to Data Platforms

In terms of contributing to data platforms, here's where my expertise comes into play:

- **Data Platform Strategy:** My skill lies in collaborating with stakeholders to identify short and long-term needs, setting priorities, and constructing a technical roadmap for the data platform.
- **Data Quality:** I collaborate with data producers, internal or external, to elevate data quality. Additionally, I can establish data quality testing infrastructure for automated contract testing.
- **Data Extraction:** My expertise extends to integrating extraction tools to diversify available data sources in the warehouse. I can also create scalable infrastructure for managing large data volumes.
- **Data Transformation:** I enjoy identifying opportunities for abstraction and reusing transformation logic. I'm also skilled in crafting tools that empower less technical users to undertake transformations.
- **Data Lake/Warehouse:** My proficiency covers planning and constructing scalable data warehouses or data lakes. I can determine optimal data structures, and formats, and configure role-based access patterns.
- **Semantic Layer:** I possess the capability to develop or integrate tools for defining business metrics from centralised data. Moreover, I can establish shared models for organisation-wide metric definitions.
Infrastructure: Each of these components requires robust infrastructure. I can manage and maintain this infrastructure, ensuring it meets SLAs.

## Unique Contributions and Attributes

Ultimately, what sets me apart are the following attributes:

- **Strategic Thinking:** I excel at crafting a technical vision aligned with overarching strategic business objectives, ensuring present efforts align with future goals.
- **Iterative Delivery:** While future alignment is crucial, I'm also skilled at challenging unnecessary complexities and charting incremental pathways to success.
- **Commercial Focus:** My commitment extends to assessing the business value of every endeavour, and seeking clarity on outcomes and impact.
- **Empathetic Leadership:** Understanding the pain points of all stakeholders, including engineers, is a priority. I help design solutions that prompt action from all involved.
- **Cultivating Growth:** I'm dedicated to nurturing teams through mentorship and delegation, elevating the technical prowess of the collective.

## Concrete Example

Let me provide an example from my tenure at LandTech. Here, I spearheaded the development of a data platform that transformed the integration of geometric datasets into application products. This initiative significantly accelerated data product delivery from several weeks to a matter of days, securing considerable recurring revenue for the company. The journey unfolded as follows:

- **Architectural Vision:** I led efforts to shape a robust architectural vision, harmonising the efforts of three engineering teams and aligning technical roadmaps.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Through collaboration with data product managers and analysts, I gained insights into strategic goals, and pain points, establishing an incrementally deliverable platform roadmap.
- **Unified Data Model:** Created a unified data model accommodating multiple datasets.
Strategic Refinement: To expedite the development of the data model and data access APIs, I identified and revamped an existing area of the system.
- **Data Quality Infrastructure:** I introduced a low-code testing infrastructure, bolstering data test creation and ensuring effective reporting.
- **Transform Layer Efficiency:** Defined reusable components within the transform layer, eliminating redundancy in transform code, and enabling streamlined additions of new datasets.
- **Team Growth:** I built a platform team from the ground up, coaching a senior engineer to a technical lead position and growing an engineer to a senior engineer.

This example encapsulates my approach and my commitment to engineering impactful solutions.
