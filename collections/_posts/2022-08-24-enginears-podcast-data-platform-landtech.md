In the past 12 months, I have been helping my team build a data platform that will enable LandTech to scale integration of thousands of geospatial and land datasets, across UK and international markets. Spoke on the Enginears Podcast about it recently.

[Enginears](https://enginears.io/) are an amazing team sharing how various tech companies are building their infrastructure and architecures. I was impressed by Elliot's boundless curiousity whilst helping us draw out the interesting things we are doing for the rest of the community. Well worth connecting with them!
