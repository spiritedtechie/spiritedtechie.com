In the past 12 months, my team have been building a data platform that enables LandTech to scale integration of thousands of geospatial and land datasets, across the UK and international markets. Spoke on the Enginears Podcast about it recently.

[Enginears](https://enginears.io/) are an amazing team sharing how various tech companies are building their infrastructure and architectures. I was impressed by Elliot's boundless curiosity whilst helping draw out the interesting things we are doing. Well worth connecting with them!
